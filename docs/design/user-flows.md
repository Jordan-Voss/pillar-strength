# Pillar Strength — User Flows (MVP)

## Primary flows
1) Sign up → onboarding questions → choose template OR create program → schedule shown
2) From schedule/today → start session → log sets (RPE optional) → finish → appears in history
3) Open insights → weekly summary + adherence + volume + top e1RM (S/B/D if present)

## Screens (MVP)
- Onboarding (questions)
- Template picker
- Program builder (basic)
- Schedule (next 14 days)
- Today / Session
- Log sets
- History
- Insights (weekly)

## Required UI states
- Loading
- Empty (no program yet / no sessions yet)
- Error (network/server)
- Validation error (bad set inputs)

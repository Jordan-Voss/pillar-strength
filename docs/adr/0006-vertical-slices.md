# ADR 0006: Vertical Slice Development

## Context
Large projects risk long feedback cycles and dead code.

## Decision
Build in vertical slices that include API, UI, tests, and docs. Each slice must be demoable.

## Consequences
- Frequent, usable checkpoints
- Scope is controlled
- Requires disciplined definition-of-done per slice
